# Code-Porfolio

Welcome to my Python portfolio!
The goal of this is to showcase my abilities to create multiple Python projects of varying complexity.
Each level is intended to be more complex than the last.
Level 1 is a simple Hello World! program.
Level 2 is a lasagna cooking time calculator that takes user inputs and calculates how long the lasagna has been cooking.
Level 3 in its current form is funcitonal but not fully complete. It is a Pokemon themed tournement simulator. It is capable of doing one battle between two trainers 
and counts the number of fainted pokemon each round first trainer to 3 faints is the loser. It looks at levels and types to decide which pokemon faints. Higher level wins but if a pokemon has a type advantage then their level is considered double during the round.
